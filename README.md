# Habit formation models
Reimplimentation of the 1999 paper By Force of Habit by Campbell & Cochrane.
This repository hosts all neccessary files for implemtation of the model. Including pricing-kernels and a MeX-compilation of Gauss-Legendre numerical integration resulting in very efficient computing.
The project was authored for the course Advanced Asset Pricing at Aarhus University BSS. Hosted by CREATES.

The model is recallibrated using recent data, but implementation of own calibrations is straightforward.
This implementation of the external habit formation model is intended for use in simulation studies.

Authored by Morten Bechmann Krogh and Rasmus MÃ¸ller Jensen in 2019.
